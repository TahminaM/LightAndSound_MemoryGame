## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
* FreeCodeCamp.org 
* W3schools.com

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

[I am taking Practical Web Development course from Hunter college this semester and I have used HTML, CSS and Javascript in some of my project, so it was relatively easy to understand a lot of the content when creating the project. Since the purpose of the project was to get introduced to the languages and understand the basics of coding, I dedicated myself to reading through them and seeing the purpose of each implemented idea, but I still would love to get more experience and concrete knowledge on all the languages in the future. However, I faced a small problem while converting my .mov file to .gif using 'Ezgif.com' website as it was chopping the last part of my each reccording. I have tried many times and overcome this problem by using 'online-convert.com' instead of 'Ezgif.com']

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
 
After completing this project, some questions that I have about web development are: 
* Where can I learn more about JavaScript and DOM manipulation? 
* What is the process of opening up a website? 
* How Web developers constantly maintain and update user data? 
* What makes a team environment run smoothly?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
 
[If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would spend it on cleaning up the website and adding some more functions such as adding different levels to the game, playtime limit (such as increasing speed limit for the next level), maintaing the number of games youâ€™ve won and a winning surprise gift, three failing tries, playfull musical sounds on the buttons and so on. ]
